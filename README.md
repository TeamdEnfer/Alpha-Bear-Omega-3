# Installing

In a new terminal, type:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TeamdEnfer/Alpha-Bear-Omega-3.git
```
Then, go into the repository, and launch the install script:
```sh
cd Alpha-Bear-Omega-3
./install.sh
```
Once the install script is launched, choose what you want to install (*all* option is recommended for first install).  
***Notes***:
- Each time the code is modified, do *catkin_make* in the *ros_ws* directory to update the executables.
- Each time a new terminal is opened, run the install script with the option *6* to update the ROS setup files.
